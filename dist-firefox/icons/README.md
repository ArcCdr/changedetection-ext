# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains the extension icons. You'll need to replace these placeholder files with actual PNG icons.

Required icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or generate them online. The icons should represent the ChangeDetection.io brand or a magnifying glass/monitoring theme.

For development, you can use simple colored squares or download icons from:
- https://icons8.com/
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://iconmonstr.com/

Make sure to use PNG format and the exact dimensions listed above.
